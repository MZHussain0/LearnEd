The industry
Generally, almost every Terms and Conditions agreement should include the subsequent clauses:

This excerpt from Amazon sets out what sellers must do, and what they must not do when it comes to IP rights. It also adds some definitions and extra information for clarity, which is helpful to the readers.

A Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability clause
This type of clause is a contractual stipulation or disclaimer for an agreement that defines the circumstances under which you (the disclaiming party) could be held responsible for damages or loss.

It further sets the boundaries of damages that may be claimed in certain situations. This clause limits the amount payable as well as the exposure a company faces if a lawsuit is filed or another claim is made.

If deemed admissible, a Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability clause can "cover" the number of possible losses to which a business is exposed.

For example, a mobile app user experiences loss because they relied on information provided on that app. A Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability clause in the app's Terms and Conditions agreement could restrict the liability of the app owner, and by extension, limit the recoverable amount of the user.`;
